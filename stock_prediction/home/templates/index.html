                <p class="text-white">The stock market is a financial market where stock of publicly traded companies are bought and sold. A stock represents an ownership share in a company and entitles the holder to a claim on a portion of the company's assets and earnings.

Stock markets exist to provide a platform for companies to raise capital by selling shares to the public, and for investors to buy and sell these shares.The stock prices are determined by supply and demand in the market.

Investors can buy and sell stocks through a brokerage account. There are various types of stock market investment strategies, such as buying and holding for the long term, day trading, or actively managing a portfolio of stocks. Some investors seek to maximize returns by buying and selling stocks frequently, while others aim to hold onto stocks for a long time in order to benefit from the potential for capital appreciation.</p>
